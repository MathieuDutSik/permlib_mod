Modification to the permlib code done by Mathieu Dutour Sikiric.
It should be completely clear that the main author of the
code is Thomas Rehn.

Goal is to add more functionality and usefulness of the code.

Modifications done:
---Add a default constructor to permutations so that
   default permutation can be generated.
---Add an extrator function for the transversals in order
   to be able to iterate over the group elements and be
   able to build groups that way.
---Add the access to the partition backtrack for some cases
   of stabilizers of sets and equivalences.

Ask mathieu.dutour@gmail.com for further questions on the
code.
